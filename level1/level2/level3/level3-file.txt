William of Rubruck
William of Rubruck, a Flemish Franciscan missionary and papal envoy to the Mongol Empire reached Karakorum in 1254. He left one of the most detailed, though not always flattering, accounts of the city. He compared it rather unfavorably to the village of Saint-Denis near Paris, and was of the opinion that the royal abbey there was ten times as magnificent as the Khan's palace.[12] On the other hand, he also described the town as a very cosmopolitan and religiously tolerant place, and the silver tree he described as part of MÃ¶ngke Khan's palace as having become the symbol of Karakorum.[13][14] He described the walled city as having four gates facing the four directions, two quarters of fixed houses, one for the "Saracenes" and one for the "Cathai", twelve pagan temples, two mosques, as well as a Nestorian church.[3][15]
